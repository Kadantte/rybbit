# Inviting Users

Currently only the cloud version of Rybbit supports inviting users.

<Steps>

### 1. Add the user to your organization

Go to https://app.rybbit.io/organization "Add Member" button in the top right. Enter the user's email address and select the user's role.

### 2. Select the user's role
 
You can either make the user an admin or a member. 

**Admins** can invite other users, add websites, edit websites, delete websites, and see all website data.

**Members** can see all website data, but they cannot edit anything.

### 3. Send the invite

Click the "Invite" button. The user will receive an email with a link to sign up for Rybbit. You can manage all invites in the organizations tab.
